# ❤️‍🔥 Credits & Acknowledgments

> **"We stand on the shoulders of giants, grooving to Trip-Hop beats."**

Homehill wouldn't exist without the inspiration, tools, and passion of many others.

## 🎵 Musical Inspirations

### Massive Attack

**Thank you for *Mezzanine***. This album is the sonic foundation of Homehill's late-night coding sessions. Its dark, atmospheric Trip-Hop beats shape the mood and aesthetic of everything we build.

- Ana's favorite album (binary tattoo: catalog number)
- Background music for architecture decisions
- Inspiration for Art Deco meets Minimalism aesthetic

*"This is how you make a masterpiece that lasts 25+ years."*

### Portishead

For teaching us that melancholy can be elegant, and silence can be as powerful as sound.

### Boards of Canada

For the warm analog nostalgia and mathematical beauty hidden in melody.

### Kate Bush

For proving that technology and emotion are not opposites, and that art can be both experimental and deeply human.

### Amon Tobin

For showing us that sound design is architecture, and chaos can have structure.

## 🛠️ Open Source Projects

### Core Infrastructure

**Alpine Linux**  
Minimalist, fast, secure. The perfect foundation for "Naked OS Brutalism."

**Docker & Docker Compose**  
Containerization made elegant. Services that know their place.

**Kubernetes (K3s)**  
Lightweight orchestration for the Orchard cluster. Power without bloat.

**Traefik**  
Reverse proxy with soul. Automatic TLS, beautiful routing, GitOps-friendly.

### Databases & Storage

**PostgreSQL**  
The world's most advanced open source database. Reliable, powerful, respectful.

**DragonflyDB**  
25x faster than Redis. Modern in-memory data store for mk3's performance.

**Btrfs**  
Copy-on-write filesystem with snapshots. "Never lose data" philosophy in action.

### Services & Applications

**Jellyfin**  
Media server that respects your freedom. No telemetry, no tracking, just music.

**Navidrome**  
Subsonic-compatible music server. Elegant, fast, perfect for mobile apps.

**Memos**  
Note-taking with privacy. Simple, effective, self-hosted.

**Portainer**  
Docker management UI. Makes container oversight accessible to everyone.

## 📚 Cultural References

### Terry Pratchett

For teaching us that:
- Complex systems need humor to survive
- Documentation should tell stories
- Goblins deserve their own UIDs

*"In a well-organized world, every goblin has their place, every Ana her own UID, and every service only the permissions it needs!"*

### The Simpsons

For endless quotes that somehow apply to infrastructure:
- "I'm in danger!" (when logs show errors)
- "Everything's coming up Milhouse!" (when deployments succeed)
- "D'oh!" (when you `rm -rf` the wrong directory)

### William Gibson

For *Neuromancer* and the vision of cyberspace as a place with architecture, beauty, and danger.

## 👥 Community & Inspiration

### r/homelab

For proving that homelabs are not just infrastructure - they're art, passion, and endless learning.

### Self-Hosting Community

For fighting against Big Tech centralization and showing that you *can* own your data, your music, your life.

### Open Source Contributors

To every developer who:
- Writes documentation
- Fixes bugs at 2 AM
- Believes software should be free (as in freedom)
- Makes their code beautiful, not just functional

**Thank you.** Homehill exists because you exist.

## 🌿 Personal Thanks

### Frau Bear (tinkerbearin)

For patience, support, and understanding why "just one more commit" turns into three hours.

Sometimes the best architecture decisions happen when you step away, breathe, and let your mind wander. 🌿✨

### Coffee

For being the liquid foundation of late-night infrastructure work. ☕
