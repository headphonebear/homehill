# Legacy Docker Swarm Services

This directory contains Docker Swarm service configurations that are being phased out in favor of:
- Kubernetes Orchard Cluster (`clusters/orchard/`)
- Standalone servers (`servers/`)

## Migration Status

Services in this directory are still operational but scheduled for migration in 2025 Q1-Q2.

See `docs/architecture.md` for migration timeline.
