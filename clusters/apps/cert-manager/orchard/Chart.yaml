description: Automated TLS certificate management for Orchard cluster at Homehill
type: application
version: 1.0.0
appVersion: "1.19.3"
# WHY: appVersion matches cert-manager's actual version

dependencies:
  - name: cert-manager
    repository: https://charts.jetstack.io
    version: "1.19.3"
    # WHY: Official cert-manager Helm chart
    # This version is stable and well-tested with Kubernetes 1.28+
    # Handles Let's Encrypt certificate issuance, renewal, and management

# NOTE: Hetzner DNS webhook will be added as a separate Application later
# WHY: Webhook needs to be installed AFTER cert-manager is running
# It extends cert-manager with DNS-01 challenge support for Hetzner DNS
